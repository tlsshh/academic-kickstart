abstract: The project aimed to decompose a single indoor image into a shading image and a reflectance image based on deep neural networks. To alleviate two main difficulties in shading estimation, we proposed to incorporate surface normal cues. Our proposed framework significantly improved the realism of the image editing application. To our knowledge, we outperformed state-of-the-art methods in shading estimation. **[submitted]**

##### Our goal was to alleviate two main difficulties in shading estimation:
  - Distinguishing shading from reflectance
  - Lack of training data
