abstract: The project provides multiple robust plane models with boundaries for the AR SDK user. <br> Given a 2D-structured 3D point cloud, the project aims to cluster it into multiple seperate point clouds, each reconstructing a common plane. Besides, it’s an incremental plane-reconstruction method which expands the old planes with new point clouds generated by the moving camera.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.

##### There are two main problems:
  - Noisy and semi-dense 3D point clouds. 
  - Real-time speed requirement.
