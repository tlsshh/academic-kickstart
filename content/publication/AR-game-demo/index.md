abstract: The augmented reality shooting game takes place in multiple planar regions in the real world. Move your phone to watch the rabbits and shoot! <br> A SLAM SDK was used to estimate the camera pose. The real-world 3D point cloud was reconstructed by stereo-matching, and I used an image-based segmentation algorithm to extract planes. The game is rendered by Unity3D.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
